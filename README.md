# Portfolio Analysis Project

## Project Overview

### Goal
Create a portfolio with a long-term buy-and-hold strategy focus that can be updated and analyzed daily. 
* ***Note that the analysis in the ReadMe.md is based on portfolio data ending June 18, 2021.***


### Initiative
**Create a portfolio consisting of 10 popular growth stocks (Apple, Facebook, Nvidia, PayPal, Shopify, Square, Teladoc, Tesla, Twitter, and Zillow)**
* Compare and analyze the historical performance of the holdings in the portfolio with each other
* Compare and analyze the portfolio's historical performance with that of the three major indexes
* Compare the historical performance of the three major indexes with the 10-Year and 30-Year Treasury Yields


### Portfolio Holdings
* Apple: $10,000
* Facebook: $10,000
* Nvidia: $10,000
* PayPal: $10,000
* Shopify: $10,000
* Square: $10,000
* Teladoc: $10,000
* Tesla: $10,000
* Twitter: $10,000
* Zillow: $10,000
* **Total: $100,000**


### Coding Tasks
* Gather and clean five years' worth of market data (01/04/2016 - June 18, 2021)
* Analyze the portfolio holdings' quantitative performance
* Analyze the portfolio's quantitative performance in relation to the S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow 30 and 10-Yr and 30-Yr Treasury Yields
* Determine the portfolio holdings' total cumulative performance
* Analyze the portfolio holdings' risk and volatility






## Project Evaluation

Based on the results of the quantitative and risk analysis, Shopify has been the best performing stock of over the last five years and looks like it will continue this trend in the near future. Since 2016, Shopify has had a cumulative return of over 5,603% meaning our initial investment of $10,000 would have grown to just over $195,000. More importantly, though, it is only offers relatively moderate risk when compared to the rest of the portfolio's holdings. 

When observing the portffolio's Annualized Stock Volatility, Shopify ranks sixth out of 10 meaning that five other stocks in the portfolio offer more risk and volatility while simultaneously providing less of a return. This is also clearly illustrated when looking at the portfolio's Annualized Sharpe Ratios. Sharpe ratio measures a stock's performance while taking into account it's level of risk - for instance, although Tesla had a higher cumulative return than Apple (almost three times as much), Apple has a higher Sharpe Ratio because it offers a very small amount of risk whereas Tesla is **very** risky so it's returns seem less attractive. Shopify has the highest Sharpe ratio of the whole portfolio because although it's returns were astronomical, it wasn't very risky for a growth stock.
